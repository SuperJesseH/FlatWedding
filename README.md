## FlatWedding - Frontend
FlatWedding is a React based wedding website with semantic ui. The goal is to have users login with a predetermined password (from invitations) that will give them access to a message board, schedule, registry information and an RSVP form.[Backend](https://github.com/SuperJesseH/FlatWeddingBackend)

## Build status
This is a work in progress (with a hard deadline!) check back for updates. Currently RSVP creates a new user, this will be refactored to an update user form.
